Code for a possible yet another music app.

Sample features:

(1) input a set of notes, output fitting scales {haskell-prototyping.hs: improScale}  
(2) input a scale, output its chords {haskell-prototyping.hs: scalechords}  
(3) input a melody, output a harmonization  
(4) input keys X, Y and an n, output n keys on a tonnetz/circle-of-fifths/... geodesic of X & Y  
(5) input a chord progression, output its negative (in the sense of Ernst Levy)  
(6) recognize known chords and scales {haskell-prototyping.hs: ictRecognizer}
